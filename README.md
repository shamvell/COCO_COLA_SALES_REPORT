Coca-Cola Product Analysis Dashboard (2022) An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, units sold, and operating profit across major Coca-Cola brands and regions. Features dynamic filters, KPIs, and visual insights to support data-driven business decisions.


This project presents an interactive Coca-Cola Product Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI, focused on analyzing sales performance, operating profit, and distribution patterns across multiple beverage brands during the year 2022. The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by offering clear, visually engaging insights at both regional and product levels.

The analysis covers key Coca-Cola brands including Coca-Cola, Dasani Water, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and Powerade. Users can dynamically filter data by brand, region, state, city, retailer, delivery company, and price per unit, allowing deep exploration of performance trends. Key performance indicators such as Total Sales (8M), Total Units Sold (16M), Number of States (48), and Cities (50) provide a high-level overview of business scale and reach.

Visualizations include operating profit by beverage brand, total sales and units sold by region, sales contribution by retailer, and transaction count distribution across regions. A geographical map highlights state-wise sales performance, making regional comparisons intuitive and actionable. The dashboard also identifies top-performing regions, with the West region leading in both sales and units sold, while Coca-Cola remains the highest-selling brand overall.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, KPI creation, interactive slicers, and advanced Power BI visualization techniques. It is suitable for showcasing business intelligence, analytical thinking, and storytelling with data.
